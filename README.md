Modelling of London's Tube network: shortest path function; graph link analysis

# Objectives
__These are the two challenges I have sought to tackle so far in this project:__
* Calculate the shortest path between two stations.
* Perform graph analysis / link analysis on the network.

# Features
Key features of the dataset:
* Undirected graph
* Interchange data

Includes all the TfL rail connections in London up to 2017 (excl. TfL Rail and Tramlink): e.g. all London Overground lines.
